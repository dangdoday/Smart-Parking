# Smart Parking System

Project of the Machine Learning (MAT3533) course in the Autumn Semester 2024 - 2025 at VNU University of Science.

## Features

- **License Plate Recognition**: Automatically detects and reads vehicle license plates using image processing techniques.
- **Sensor Integration**: Employs sensors to monitor parking space occupancy in real-time.
- **LED Matrix Display**: Provides visual indicators for parking availability and system status.
- **Automated Entry/Exit**: Controls barriers and logs vehicle movements based on license plate data.
